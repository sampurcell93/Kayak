This challenge took me about ten hours to complete. 

Features
========
Here are some UI features that I built into my interface.

*Filtering* - The filter bar supports a search for names or categories. For example, a search for "G" will return all businesses withj a "g" or a "G" in their name. A search for "Indian" will return all restaurants who are categorized as Indian food. Additionally, the filter buttons can eliminate food and/or hotels from the results. 

*Sorting* - The sort menu will sort all the current results into the order that you select. The currently supported options are rating and distance.
